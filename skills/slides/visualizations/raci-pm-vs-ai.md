Updated: Oct 23, 2025

Legend
- R — Responsible (does the work)
- A — Accountable (approves/owns outcome; single owner)
- C — Consulted (two-way input)
- I — Informed (one-way updates)

### 1) Product Strategy

| Task | PM (Human) | AI Agent |
|---|---|---|
| Product strategy & OKRs | A/R | C |
| Scenario modeling & impact analysis | A/C | R |

### 2) Research & Insight Synthesis (Competitive/Market)

| Task | PM (Human) | AI Agent |
|---|---|---|
| Signal scanning & insight synthesis | A/C | R |
| Competitive/market research synthesis | A/C | R |

### 3) Roadmapping & Prioritization

| Task | PM (Human) | AI Agent |
|---|---|---|
| Roadmap options & dependency mapping | A/C | R |
| Prioritization (scoring, trade-offs) | A/R | C |

### 4) Delivery & Execution (Artifacts + Launch)

| Task | PM (Human) | AI Agent |
|---|---|---|
| Backlog triage & de-duplication | A | R |
| Requirement synthesis (PRD drafts) | A/C | R |
| Acceptance criteria & completeness checks | A/C | R |
| Launch planning, updates & reporting | A/C | R |

### 5) Measurement & Insights

| Task | PM (Human) | AI Agent |
|---|---|---|
| Measurement & insights (metrics → narrative) | A/C | R |
| Post-launch review & learning loop | A (facilitation) | R (analysis) |

Guardrails & escalation
- PM remains Accountable across all decisions, customer commitments, and scope/priority changes.
- Escalate to PM-only R+A when any of the following apply:
  - Legal/compliance implications, pricing or contract terms.
  - Security/privacy exposure or regulated data handling.
  - High-impact roadmap changes or irreversible migrations.
  - Material customer/stakeholder contention or reputational risk.

Operating notes
- AI drafts, synthesizes, plans, and monitors; PM curates, sets constraints, and approves before publication/execution.
- Keep audit trails (prompts/outputs), evaluation results, and decision logs for reviews and post-launch learning.
