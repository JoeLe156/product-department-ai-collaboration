# Product Management AI 2025–2030 — Slide Outline (Draft)

Note: Built to the constraints in `slides/main-prompt.md`. All data points in the final deck will be dated "as of Oct 2025" with on-slide citations and detailed endnotes.

### 1. Current state of AI products & AI-assisting processes
- AI products: chatbot & assistant, creative and generative AI, recommendation system, autonomous system
- AI-assisted processes: Automation of repetitive tasks, accelerated content and code generation, business process modeling, customer service, work planning
- AI-assisted product management tasks: see concrete examples in `slides/internet-references-on-ai-takes/notebooklm.md`
Preliminary sources: Pew Research Center — About 1 in 5 U.S. workers now use AI in their job (Oct 6, 2025); Microsoft — Work Trend Index 2025 (Frontier Firm); Stanford HAI — 2025 AI Index (Economy/Technical Performance); Asana — Summer 2025 Release (AI workflows).

### 2. State of AI for PM Workflows (2025–2026)
- PM workflows shift from manual production to AI-orchestrated execution: strategy/roadmap/prioritization (reasoning + impact simulations), launch planning & communications (auto plans, proactive updates, stakeholder alignment), continuous research (deep synthesis, Research-of-Record from internal tools, de-dupe + backlog hygiene), and product artifacts (PRD drafts, prototype-first, design/code assist).
- From pilots to scale: Copilot case studies show measurable gains; scaling hinges on integration, governance, and skills. Frontier labs (OpenAI, DeepMind, Anthropic) raise reliability/safety via model/system documentation that underpins these PM use cases.

### 6. Product Strategy � Signal Scanning & Scenarioing
- AI thought partner using agent skills (planning, tool/computer use) for strategy ideation; monitor signals and cluster JTBD; quantify impact to tie work to outcomes.
- Agent-led what-ifs and sensitivity analyses to test themes/bets and surface decision trade-offs.
Preliminary sources: CB Insights — Research 2025; Gartner — Market Guides 2025; McKinsey — Product Strategy 2025.; Anthropic � Agent skills (Computer Use/Tool Use) 2025.

### 7. Roadmapping & Prioritization � Dynamic Replans
- Use agent skills (planner + tool/computer use) to generate options from backlog/constraints with reasoning-assisted 2x2s, confidence-weighted ROI, and dependency detection.
- Agents continuously replan on signal changes; de-duplicate requests and maintain backlog hygiene across Jira/Linear.

### 8. Launch Planning & Execution � Orchestrated GTM
- Agent skills orchestrate auto-generated launch plans/timelines, sync owners/dates across tools; proactive prep and next actions.
- Computer-use + tool-use automate updates, agendas, action items, and decision docs for alignment.
Preliminary sources: Asana — AI 2025; Microsoft 365 — Copilot 2025; Harvard Business Review.; Anthropic � Agent skills (Computer Use/Tool Use) 2025.

### 9. Competitive & Market Research � Continuous
- Agent skills (computer-use + retrieval) drive deep research/synthesis; build Research-of-Record from internal tools.
- Real-time transcript mining; agents auto de-duplicate issues/update backlogs; generate SWOT/feature parity.
Preliminary sources: data.ai — Market Pulse 2025; Similarweb — Industry Reports 2025; Gartner — Competitive Landscape 2025.; Anthropic � Agent skills (Computer Use/Tool Use) 2025.

### 10. Product Artifacts � PRDs, Flows, Specs
- Agent skills draft/iterate PRDs from transcripts; consolidate feedback, resolve comments; map text to components.
- Computer-use assists prototype-first workflow (Figma/Repos/Confluence); PMs/designers propose design/code changes quickly.
- Auto-cluster/prioritize and draft PRDs from transcripts.
- Acceptance-criteria checks and traceable review resolution.

### 11. Measurement & Insights � From Metrics to Narratives
- Math/tool-use agent skills recommend KPIs and auto-generate queries; connect work to impact via effect sizing and experiments.
- Agents detect anomalies, surface hypotheses, and draft plain-language narratives for execs.
