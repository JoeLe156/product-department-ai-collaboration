Trending PM workflows

- PM workflows are shifting from manual production to AI‑orchestrated execution across strategy/roadmap/prioritization, launch planning & communications, continuous research, and product artifacts. [Deloitte 2025][HBR 2025]
- Case evidence shows efficiency gains in planning/communication; scaling depends on integration, governance, and skills. [MS Copilot Case Studies][Deloitte 2025]
- Prototype‑first product artifacts: AI drafts PRDs and assists design/code; lab documentation improves reliability and safety for these uses. [OpenAI 2024‑2025][Anthropic 2025][DeepMind 2025]
