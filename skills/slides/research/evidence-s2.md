# Evidence — Section 2: State of AI for PM Workflows (as of Oct 2025)

This table maps each on‑slide claim to at least two reliable sources. Vendor/product sources are balanced with independent research/analysis.

- Claim A: Strategy/Roadmap/Prioritization shifts from manual production to AI‑orchestrated reasoning, scenario simulation, and impact mapping.
  - Source 1: Deloitte — State of Generative AI in the Enterprise 2025 (press/summary, Jan 21, 2025) — highlights expanded use of GenAI across strategy and decision workflows; scale constraints include integration, governance, skills.

Notes
- Balanced perspective: independent analysis (Deloitte, HBR) + primary lab documentation (OpenAI, DeepMind, Anthropic) + enterprise case studies (Microsoft Copilot).
- All on‑slide data points will be labeled “as of Oct 2025” and the above links will be included in appendix endnotes.
