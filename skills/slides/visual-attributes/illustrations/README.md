# Illustrations — Vivid Gradient Minimal

Use this folder for illustration assets used in the PM + AI deck. Prefer SVG. Keep single assets ≤300KB.

Guidelines
- Style: abstract geometric or light isometric; no heavy realism.
- Color: apply a duotone/tint matching theme accents; avoid >3 accent hues/asset.
- Contrast: when on gradient backgrounds, place inside a .illu--card container.
- Licensing: ensure assets are original or permissively licensed (e.g., unDraw, OpenMoji, Iconoir). Track sources in appendix.

Suggested motifs
- Agent orchestration (nodes/edges with task “pills”).
- Roadmap/prioritization (2×2 grid, dependency arrows).
- Launch/GTM (timeline with owner badges).
- Research/RoR (stacked docs, magnifier, radar).
- Prototype‑first (wireframe blocks, code/design dual icons).
- Insights/evaluation (sparkline with spotlight, check/balance).

Files
- placeholder.svg — simple gradient/shape motif for quick previews.
