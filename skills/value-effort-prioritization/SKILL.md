name: value-effort-prioritization
description: Strategically evaluate and prioritize tasks by analyzing their potential impact (value) against required resources (effort). Use when prioritizing work, making project decisions, evaluating competing demands, or optimizing task allocation. Helps identify high-leverage opportunities and eliminate low-value activities.

# Value-Effort Prioritization Skill

## Quick Start

Use this skill when you need to:
- Decide which tasks to focus on among competing demands
- Evaluate whether a project is worth your time
- Optimize your task list for maximum impact
- Say "no" to low-value work strategically

**Basic workflow:**
1. List the tasks/projects you're evaluating
2. Rate each on Value (1-10) and Effort (1-10)
3. Calculate the ratio (Value ÷ Effort)
4. Prioritize by quadrant and ratio
5. Act on high-leverage opportunities first

## Framework: The Value-Effort Matrix

### The Four Quadrants

**Q1: High Value, Low Effort (Quick Wins)**
- Execute immediately
- These tasks deliver significant impact without consuming much time
- Priority: FIRST

**Q2: High Value, High Effort (Strategic Investments)**
- Schedule strategically with dedicated focus time
- These transform your work but require commitment
- Break into milestones to manage complexity
- Priority: SECOND

**Q3: Low Value, Low Effort (Time Wasters)**
- Batch together or automate
- Easy to do but don't meaningfully advance goals
- Consume attention without returning value
- Priority: THIRD (minimize)

**Q4: Low Value, High Effort (Energy Drains)**
- Delegate, defer, or delete
- Consume significant resources without proportional payoff
- Often habitual or obligation-driven
- Priority: LAST (avoid)

## Core Decision Framework

### Step 1: Define Value

Ask: "What's the actual impact if I complete this?"

**Scoring guidance (1-10):**
- **1-2:** Minimal impact; doesn't affect goals or outcomes
- **3-4:** Minor impact; nice-to-have improvement
- **5-6:** Moderate impact; contributes to progress
- **7-8:** Significant impact; directly advances goals
- **9-10:** Transformative; unlocks new possibilities or prevents major problems

**Questions to sharpen assessment:**
- Does this directly move me toward my goals?
- Who benefits and how? (self, team, customers, stakeholders)
- What happens if I don't do this?
- Does this create leverage for future work?

### Step 2: Estimate Effort

Ask: "What will this actually cost in time, energy, and resources?"

**Scoring guidance (1-10):**
- **1-2:** Trivial; 15 minutes or less, minimal friction
- **3-4:** Light; under 2 hours, straightforward execution
- **5-6:** Moderate; 2-8 hours, some complexity or coordination needed
- **7-8:** Heavy; 1-3 days, high complexity or multiple dependencies
- **9-10:** Massive; multiple days/weeks, significant coordination or learning curve

**Questions to sharpen assessment:**
- Do I have the skills/knowledge needed, or do I need to learn?
- What dependencies exist? (people, systems, information)
- What's my personal friction with this type of work?
- What's my confidence in my estimate? (Be generous.)

### Step 3: Calculate Priority

**Quick ratio method:** Value ÷ Effort
- Higher ratios = better leverage
- Example: Task A (Value 8, Effort 2) = 4.0 ratio
- Example: Task B (Value 8, Effort 8) = 1.0 ratio
- Prioritize Task A first

**Quadrant then ratio approach:**
1. Do all Q1 tasks (high value-to-effort ratio inherently)
2. Among Q2 tasks, prioritize by ratio
3. Minimize Q3 and Q4

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall: "Everything feels urgent"

**Why it happens:** Urgency isn't the same as importance. Pressure from external deadlines or vocal stakeholders can blur this distinction.

**Fix:**
- Separate deadline (when it's due) from value (why it matters)
- Ask: "Is this deadline actually real, or am I assuming it?"
- Weekly review: Distinguish between truly urgent and habitually urgent

### Pitfall: "I consistently underestimate effort"

**Why it happens:** Optimism bias and incomplete information make estimates too low.

**Fix:**
- Track actual time spent on past projects
- Build in 25-50% buffer to your estimates
- Ask someone experienced: "How long would this realistically take you?"
- Break large tasks into smaller pieces for more accurate estimation

### Pitfall: "I rate everything as high value"

**Why it happens:** Difficulty saying no, people-pleasing, or misaligned priorities.

**Fix:**
- Clarify your actual top 3 goals for the next quarter
- Rate value *relative to those goals specifically*
- Ask: "Does this move me closer to my stated priorities?"
- If value keeps inflating, revisit what your real priorities are

### Pitfall: "I avoid high-effort tasks"

**Why it happens:** The effort feels overwhelming; perfectionism delays starting.

**Fix:**
- Break Q2 (high value, high effort) tasks into smaller milestones
- Start with the smallest possible first step
- Track progress, not just completion
- Celebrate milestone progress to maintain momentum

### Pitfall: "I can't say no to requests"

**Why it happens:** Fear of conflict, unclear boundaries, or not wanting to disappoint people.

**Fix:**
- Frame "no" as protecting capacity: "I need to protect time for [actual priority]"
- Offer alternatives: "I can't do this, but I could do X instead"
- Use the matrix: "This doesn't align with my current priorities"
- Remember: "No" to low-value work means "yes" to high-value work

## Application Scenarios

### Work: Task Prioritization
You have requests to: join a committee, fix a bug, design a process improvement, and attend networking.

**Analysis:**
- Committee (Value 4, Effort 6) → Q3 → Decline gracefully
- Bug fix (Value 7, Effort 3) → Q1 → Do today
- Process improvement (Value 9, Effort 8) → Q2 → Schedule focused blocks
- Networking (Value 5, Effort 2) → Q3 → Attend selectively

**Decision:** Focus on bug fix, schedule improvement project, decline committee, selective networking.

### Personal: Learning & Growth
You want to learn Python, maintain fitness, spend time with family, keep up with industry news, develop leadership skills.

**Analysis:**
- Python learning (Value 8, Effort 7) → Q2 → Schedule 5 hours/week
- Fitness (Value 8, Effort 6) → Q2 → Non-negotiable 3x/week
- Family time (Value 9, Effort 4) → Q1 → Protect ruthlessly
- Industry news (Value 5, Effort 3) → Q3 → 15 min/week newsletter
- Leadership (Value 9, Effort 8) → Q2 → Find mentor; monthly practice

**Decision:** Protect family time, commit to fitness and leadership development, batch news consumption, schedule Python learning with accountability.

### Creative: Project Management
You're managing: client project with tight deadline, experimental side project, knowledge base documentation, team mentoring, industry speaking opportunity.

**Analysis:**
- Client project (Value 10, Effort 9) → Q2 → Primary focus
- Side project (Value 7, Effort 8) → Q2 → Decide: can you do both?
- Documentation (Value 6, Effort 4) → Q3 → Delegate or automate
- Mentoring (Value 8, Effort 5) → Q1/Q2 → Protect 2 hours/week
- Speaking (Value 7, Effort 6) → Q2 → Evaluate: does it align with current priorities?

**Decision:** Commit to client project, potentially defer side project, delegate documentation, keep mentoring, decide on speaking based on strategic fit.
