## Methodology Notes

**Value Scoring Criteria (1-10):**
- 1-2: Minimal impact; doesn't affect goals or outcomes
- 3-4: Minor impact; nice-to-have improvement
- 5-6: Moderate impact; contributes to progress
- 7-8: Significant impact; directly advances goals
- 9-10: Transformative; unlocks new possibilities or prevents major problems

**Effort Scoring Criteria (1-10):**
- 1-2: Trivial; 15 minutes or less, minimal friction
- 3-4: Light; under 2 hours, straightforward execution
- 5-6: Moderate; 2-8 hours, some complexity or coordination needed
- 7-8: Heavy; 1-3 days, high complexity or multiple dependencies
- 9-10: Massive; multiple days/weeks, significant coordination or learning curve

**Priority Calculation:** Value Ã· Effort = Leverage Ratio
- Higher ratios indicate better leverage
- Q1 tasks (high value, low effort) are prioritized first
- Q2 tasks (high value, high effort) are strategic investments
